## December 2025 — Entry 1

Start writing here.

You can use **bold**, *italic*, and lists:

- A question that’s stuck in my head  
- A future I can’t quite picture  
- A fear I don’t fully understand  

(When you add new entries later, just come back to this file and add new `##` headings and text underneath.)
