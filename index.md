# Ryan's Meditations

Ever since I was young, I've loved learning about Roman history. I can't actually remember what sparked it. Maybe it's a love of history in general that comes from my father, or maybe it was a movie I saw once and just thought "that looks cool."

A roommate introduced me to "Meditations". A private journal written by Marcus Aurelius, a Stoic Philosopher and considered to be the final Emporer of Pax Romana (the golden years of the Roman Empire.) His journal became a place to reason with himself, confront his fears, refine his principles, and make sense of a world that often felt chaotic and beyond his control.

I’m borrowing the name for the same reason.

This project isn’t meant to be polished or definitive. It’s a running journal of my questions, uncertainties, thoughts and observations that I have in my life.

They’re meditations in the original sense of the word:

An attempt to think clearly about things that are difficult to think about.

I may visit this daily, or there maybe be months or even years between writings. My only ask, for whoever may read this one day - don't judge me for my imperfections. I'm just a person trying to figure out this life like everyone else.

## Would It Be Cliche?

Can I start by asking what our purpose is here on this earth? 

I guess I can start with whatever I'd like to.

Are we here to love? To fight? Simply to progress?

## Curiosity

I think I may be cursed with curiosity - a mind that wanders and constantly wonders "what if?"

The phrase "ignorance is bliss" makes so much sense to me lately. The more ignorant you are, the less you have to worry about and life seems simpler. I think there's a direct correlation between intelligence and happiness stemming from ignorance.

But how can one not wonder? Are there other life forms out there in the world? How much time do I have left with my family? What will life look like in 30 years if I'm still here - will there finally be flying cars that were promised to my mother by shows like The Jetsons?

It's absolutely crazy to me that I'm here in this life right now. Think of all of the pieces that needed to fall into place for me to be alive. The sheer chance of my parents meeting and falling in love out of 7 billion people in the world.

The world is how many billions of years old? What is the chance that Earth has the perfect conditions to sustain life? If you really start to zoom out, we are like a single speck of sand on a beach that is miles long. 

I struggle with thinking about these types of things. It makes me feel very small.

## Tuesday - a poem written for my dad

The night comes along, and without fail or delay,
We make our way to the theater, our weekly getaway.

The lights dim, the world outside fades away,
History and fiction, ready to intertwine and play.

Our favorite characters fill the big screen,
Iron Man, James Bond, and everyone in between.

Week by week the movies shift and unfold,
Each one telling us of an epic adventure, or story untold.
 


You used to look up movie showings in the paper,
Crumpled up ticket stubs in pockets, found days later.

You used to whisper endings in my ear, soft and clear,
Now I read expressions on your face, where time’s lines have appeared.

He wrestles with his popcorn, skipping dinner for his favorite treat,
Twizzlers emerge from his jacket, sugary joy he can’t defeat.

Engines scream, lions roar, punches land in the night,
He shifts in his chair, as if he’s part of the fight.
 


The credits roll, the theater hums with quiet release,
A memory has formed, a moment that will never cease.

Somewhere between the theater and home, a realization hits me,
It’s never been about the movie, an actor, a story on the screen.

No matter how busy life gets, it’s our escape, this is ours,
I wouldn’t trade anything in the world for these precious hours.

I hope one day I have a son that loves movies too,
Spending Tuesday with my dad is my favorite thing to do.

## A burden or a gift?

Is empathy a burden or a gift?

Probably both, depending on how you look at it.

## A Shift In Perspective

When I was little, I wanted a lot of money, a big house, fancy sports cars and to travel the world. 

Now, I want time to spend with family.
Now, I want the freedom to do what makes me happy.
Now, I want someone to love that loves me back.
Now, I want to be able to teach others.
Now, I want to be kind to others, even if kindness is not shown to me.

...I still want to travel the world.

## It's the small things for me

I don't need fancy presents, huge gestures, or many friends that aren't really my friends. 

To me, it's all about the small things.

The good morning texts. Close friends checking in to see how you're doing. A handwritten letter. Waking up to coffee already made because someone knows I have a busy day. Someone saying thank you and meaning it.

## Time is a construct

I once saw a video that changed my whole perspective on time. I can't even find the video now.

It was two men (probably in their 40's) just chatting about life and they brought up the topic of their parents. 

The first man asked the second man how often he sees his parents.

The reply came from the second man: "About twice a year."

They discussed how old their parents were and came to a conclusion that if the parents stayed healthy, the second man would have about 20 more years with his parents. 

Because of how our brains perceive time, a year seems pretty long. 20 years can even be hard to conceptualize. But when you break things down into smaller, more realistic settings, it can be eye opening.

The first man says to the second man, "I hate to break it to you, but you don't have 20 more years with your parents. You have 40 more times that you'll see your parents in person. 40 more times you can give your mom a hug goodbye."

When it gets broken down like that, it's very powerful.


This video has stayed in my head for a very long time, and probably will for the rest of my life. It was one of the main reasons that I moved from Philadelphia back to Connecticut - to be close to my parents. It was incomprehensible to think that I may only see my parents 100 more times if they lived another 25 years and I went home 4x per year.

Would you want your child to marry someone like you?
