# Meditations In The Age Of Complexity

Marcus Aurelius wrote Meditations as a private notebook — a place to reason with himself, confront his fears, refine his principles, and make sense of a world that often felt chaotic and beyond his control. He never intended it to be published.

I’m borrowing the name for the same reason.

This project isn’t meant to be polished or definitive. It’s a running journal of questions, uncertainties, and observations.

These entries are not conclusions.
They’re meditations in the original sense of the word:
an attempt to think clearly about things that are difficult to think about.

## Would It Be Cliche?

Is it cliche to start this by asking what our purpose is here on this earth?
